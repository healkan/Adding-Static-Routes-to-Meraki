# Adding-Static-Routes-to-Meraki

This project creates multiple static routes entries to a Meraki network.  Adding a few static routes entry is easy in the Meraki Dashboard, but what if there are a few hundred route entries.  This Pytho script takes a CSV file and convert each entry into a static route entry in the Meraki network.
